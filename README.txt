Good luck getting this to compile. The source code shouldn't be a big problem
and should be compatible with the 3ds max SDK version of the last few years.
Configuring Visual Studio projects for some version of the max SDK is the hard
part. I have uploaded what works (or worked?) for me...at least if you move
the src directory to the correct place...it's madness.
